<h1 align="center">Create: Power Grid</h1>

<p>Create: Power Grid is a mod that adds physics-based electricity simulation to the Create mod.</p>
<p>
Just like in the main mod, everything is designed to encourage creativity while introducing new challenges and obstacles.
In the end you will be the proud owner of a world-wide power grid - one that <i>hopefully</i> doesn't collapse after you
flip that one unmarked switch...
</p>
<p>
Create's in-game 'Ponder' documentation will walk you through the basic physics behind the mod and help you get started
with concepts like Ohm's law.
